DISCO:
 - With inheritance, you can still refer to subclasses with the class type of their superclass.
 - If you plan on using the class type of a superclass to refer to a subclass's method that IS NOT present in the superclass, you will get an error.
 
QCC:
 - You can use protected to have a subclass refer to an inherited instance variable. Is there a similar way for a superclass to refer to a subclass's instance variable?

NOTES:
- When a subclass inherits private variables from a superclass, it cannot alter the variable directly.
- You can overwrite methods that are inherited from a superclass.
- Use protected to allow a subclass to access inherited instance variables.
